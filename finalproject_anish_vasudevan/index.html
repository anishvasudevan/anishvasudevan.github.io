                           <p>All Annie Levin has to do is sign in, scroll and click to enter the Bandersnatch rabbit hole. This alternate dimension, linked to the one of the many University Union email accounts, has years and years of archived conversations between students working for the organization and agencies representing some of the artists who play in the annual concert series.</p> 

                           <p>As this year’s coordinator, Levin said she can take inspiration from what other UU members have done in the past with her access to the Bandersnatch email. She can see what artists her peers reached out to, but failed to secure more than a decade ago. She can see how some of the most unique finds, like J. Cole, five years before his hit album “2014 Forest Hill Drive,” or Walk the Moon, three years before their viral song “Shut Up and Dance,” came into fruition.</p>

                           <p>“The history is crazy,” Levin said. “You’re trying to catch these artists before they break and you’re betting on them early, which is something that Bandersnatch has been able to do for so long.”</p>

                           <p>Since 2003, Bandersnatch has been one of University Union’s annual concert series, routinely focused on highlighting lesser-known acts who would be somewhat popular among the college audience. UU prides themselves on trying to find the "next big thing" with roughly 40% of its previous acts currently having over a million listens on Spotify. Levin, and the countless other Bandersnatch coordinators in the past, have also placed an emphasis on unconventional genres as well, not pigeon-holing themselves to showing typical hip-hop or pop acts which students can already see at other UU events like Juice Jam or BlockParty.</p>

                           <p>“The whole point of the Bandersnatch Music Series is to bring the music back to the students and expose them to great music up close and personal,” said Sherlen Archibald in a <a href="https://dailyorange.com/2004/03/catch-22-to-play-free-show-in-schine/" target="_blank">Daily Orange article</a> as the then-co-president of Bandersnatch, in 2004.</p>

                          <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12190600"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

                           <p>The event itself usually takes place once or twice a semester, opening up with a student band before another act and then a headliner. Levin said giving student acts the chance to perform on-stage besides professional musicians is one of the most rewarding aspects of programming Bandersnatch.</p>

                           <p>Levin will attend some of the basement house shows littered around campus and take notes of what student acts some of her peers like before trying to book them for the concert. This semester, student band Froggies opened up the show before Tommy Lefroy and finally Emotional Oranges took the stage.</p>

                           <p>Some student acts have used the concert series as a launchpad in recent years like Charlie Burg, who now has over 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify after performing at a Bandersnatch show when he was a senior in 2018. But the majority of the budget, which is set prior to the school year and significantly less than what Juice Jam or BlockParty spends on booking an artist, is spent on the other two acts.</p> 

                           <p>“Having a smaller budget pushes us to think more out of the box and be more creative,” Levin said.</p> 

                           <p>The disparity itself is quite large between both shows as a Bandersnatch performer has only been more popular than a Block Party headliner just once in the last decade. Usually, there's a big difference in terms of Spotify listeners between both acts, as shown in the chart below.</p>

                            <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12190847"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


                           <p>The creative choices usually revolve around the coordinator and if they want to try and get acts either similar or completely different from the acts performing at the bigger shows on campus, Levin added. For example, punk rock band Against Me! <a href="https://dailyorange.com/2005/09/against-me-kicks-off-bandersnatch-s-fall-concert-series/" target="_blank">began the fall series of Bandersnatch</a> in 2005 months before rapper <a href="https://dailyorange.com/2005/05/snoop-energizes-crowd-with-visuals-mix-of-fan-favorites/" target="_blank">Snoop Dogg headlined Block Party</a> at the end of the spring semester. In 2013 though, Chance the Rapper performed a sold-out Bandersnatch show prior to when fellow rapper Kendrick Lamar visited campus.</p>

                           <p>“I think the fact that Chance’s show sold so well is a testament to our ability to pick the right artists for the Bandersnatch series,” said Billy Ceskavich, president of University Union at the time, in a <a href="https://dailyorange.com/2013/11/leave-it-to-chance-twenty-year-old-chicago-native-rapper-hypes-up-sold-out-crowd-in-schine-underground/" target="_blank">Daily Orange article</a>. “When we book Bandersnatch shows, we look for artists that are on the cusp of getting big.”</p>

                           <p>Last year, prior to Baby Keem and 2 Chainz performance at 2022’s Block Party, Levin followed the blueprint from almost a decade earlier and booked another hip-hop/rap artist in Pierre Bourne, which she said was in response to what the majority of students wanted. This is the exact opposite of what students used to request in the early days of Bandersnatch as the first hip-hop/rap act was rapper Styles P in April 2008.</p> 

                           <p>The recent trend of hip-hop/rap being the more popular genre has led to a growing interest by students in genres like indie and rock, Levin added. Bandersnatch wants to provide music for that audience.</p>

                           <p>“We want to appeal to different crowds and not have the same people performing every time,” Levin said. “We know that every student’s taste is different and we want an event that students can go to and be excited about.”</p>

                           <p>Another recent development has been the rise of EDM or house music, something Levin said she personally has been interested in as well. She expects future Bandersnatch coordinators to try and shift the focus of the show into that direction.</p> 

                           <p>“We definitely need more diversification of genre,” Levin said. “It's really exciting to have the power to switch things up on campus and enrich student life.”</p>

                           <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/12190368"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

                           <p>The differences in genre would bring a different crowd to each show, Levin added, but the goal of trying to find a somewhat underground artist remains the same. Since high school, Levin has had a music blog where she reaches out to some of the smaller musicians she enjoys, reaches out to them and publishes an interview. She said that everyone else in UU has a similar kind of passion, wanting to be responsible for bringing their discovery to campus.</p>

                           <p>“The power we have as students to find some of these artists is magical,” Levin said.</p>
